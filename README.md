Abstract: 

Disposition predictions made with arrival data from the Emergency Department (ED) may benefit hospital admission processes.  However, the task is susceptible to problems with class imbalance, as typically only 10-30% of ED patients are admitted. Class imbalance handling, including oversampling, under-sampling, and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) was utilized with 4 learning algorithms (Random Forests, boosting, Naïve Bayes and logistic regression), comparing the area-under-curve (AUC), as well as partial AUC (with low false positive rates). No significant improvement was observed for total AUC; in some cases, balancing was detrimental. Naïve Bayes was inferior to other learners; thus, a significant partial AUC improvement using SMOTE with Bayes may not be practical. Multiple learner types appear robust to degree of class imbalance, number of cases, and features. Learner and feature selection may be more effectual than class balancing in similar data.
